## Postmortem

> A few things to note before reading. CRDT is an abbreviation for [Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types](https://crdt.tech/). I will also refer to the individual CRDT operations as opcodes. I noticed a similarity between the role that [opcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode) play within CPU architectures and operation-based CRDTs. I am simply borrowing the terminology.

Pending.
